 !NOT COMPLETED!

 This is a simpple implementation for the classic Blackjack card game

 # Rules

 The player is dealt two cards face-up, and the dealer is dealt two cards as well, but only one of the dealer's cards should be face-up. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, and all other cards are worth their face value (2-10). The player can choose to:
    Hit: Draw another card.
    Stand: Keep the current hand.
The dealer must keep hitting until their hand totals 17 or more. If the player or the dealer exceeds 21 points, they "bust" and lose the game.
The winner is determined by whose hand is closest to 21 without exceeding it.
